# CS-305-software-security

Client Summary:
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required an evaluation of its software for potential security vulnerabilities. The company's goal was to identify weaknesses in its software systems and implement secure coding practices to safeguard sensitive financial data and comply with industry regulations.

Strengths in Finding Vulnerabilities:
I successfully identified and documented various software vulnerabilities, focusing on critical issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and weak encryption. My thorough analysis ensured a comprehensive assessment, highlighting areas for improvement. Secure coding is essential to protect client data, maintain compliance, and enhance customer trust, which directly contributes to the companyâ€™s stability and reputation.

Challenges or Helpful Parts:
The most challenging aspect was distinguishing between false positives and actual vulnerabilities, which required detailed testing and analysis. This experience, however, was instrumental in refining my problem-solving skills and understanding of security measures.

Enhancing Security Layers:
I increased the security layers by implementing strong input validation, encryption techniques, and secure coding practices like parameterized queries. In the future, I would use tools like static analysis, dynamic testing, and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and prioritize mitigation techniques.

Ensuring Functionality and Security:
After refactoring the code, I conducted unit tests and functional tests to ensure the application still met user requirements while being secure. I also performed security testing to confirm that new vulnerabilities were not introduced during refactoring.

Helpful Resources and Tools:
I utilized tools such as OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and secure coding guidelines, which were highly effective. These tools and practices will be useful in future projects for identifying vulnerabilities and improving software security.

Portfolio Value for Future Employers:
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment, apply secure coding practices, and ensure the integrity of software systems. It is a practical example of my skills in software security, making it a valuable artifact for showcasing to future employers.
